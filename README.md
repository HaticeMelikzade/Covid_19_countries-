COVID-19 Data Analysis Project ðŸ“ŠðŸ¦ 
Introduction
Welcome to my first data analysis project! In this exploration, I leverage SQL to unravel the complexities of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The project revolves around detailed analyses of datasets related to deaths, vaccinations, and infections, providing valuable insights into the worldwide impact of the virus.

Key Features
1. Comprehensive Data Exploration:
Dive deep into COVID-19 data through SQL queries, examining trends and patterns.
2. Detailed Vaccination Analysis:
Investigate the relationship between vaccination efforts and infection rates over time.
3. Geographical and Demographic Insights:
Analyze how different countries and continents are affected, exploring infection rates relative to population size.
4. Dynamic Visualizations:
Utilize SQL to calculate and visualize critical metrics like death percentages and population infection rates.
Project Components
1. SQL Queries and Join Operations:
Crafted SQL queries for extracting, filtering, and analyzing data from COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations tables.
Implemented join operations to integrate datasets seamlessly.
2. Data Transformation:
Calculated key metrics such as death percentages and population infection rates.
3. Views and Temporary Tables:
Used views and temporary tables for code organization and to simplify complex queries.
Future Plans
As my first project, I welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement. Future plans include expanding the analysis, incorporating additional datasets, and refining SQL skills for more sophisticated insights.
